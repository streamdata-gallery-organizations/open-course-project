description: The Open in Open Course Project means devotion to free information and
  Open Source technologies. The data that is compiled to service this website is regularly
  extracted directly from various CNU websites, but its provided centrally using RESTful
  API standards to any interested students or third parties. If you are creating your
  own service or even a personal application using course, term, or instructor data,
  you are welcomed to use the API detailed on this page. General API endpoints are
  keyless and anonymous for now. If youre interested in using it for your projects,
  please dont abuse it. Otherwise Ill have to buy a bike lock.
